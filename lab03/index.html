            <p> My first webpage! When I started this assignment;
                I was a bit confused and it seemd like I would not 
                be able to do it. As I started, after following instructions
                given; it became more clear and understanbable. I always go 
                back to read the course or the practices to see where I might have 
                difficulties. HTML BASICS helped me to have  better comprehension of 
                webpages and how they are conceived and displayed.

            <h4>Notes for Lab02 and Lab03</h4>

            <div id="big">I learned a lot from lab2 and lab3 </div>

            <p> From lab02 , I learned about the basics of HTML, how to procede when I 
                am planning on creating a website based on the webpage content. Since a website consists 
                of many files,as text content, codes, stylesheet, media content,links, and so on; I learned
                how to assembles after creating files for the project into a sensible structure before uploading
                onto the server online. Minimizing errors during file's and folfer naming process by using lowercase
                with no space, because many web servers  are case sensitive. Also, I learned that HTML is a markup 
                language use to structure a webpage and it's content. HTML uses a series of elements, to enclose,
                or wrap, different parts of the conten to make it appear a certain way or behave 
                in a certain way.
                The anatomy of an HTML  element is: 
                <ol>
                    <li>The opening tag;</li>
                    <li>The closing tag;</li>
                    <li>The content, which is what is found inside both tags;</li>
                    <li>The element, which is represented by the opening tag, the closing tag, and the content.</li>
                    <li> Element can have attributes(an attribute contain extra information
                        about the element that you don't want to appear on the actual content)</li>
                </ol>
            
            <p> In lab03, I learned more about CSS basics, CSS stands for Cascade style Sheet. The purpose of CSS is
                to describe how HTML element are to be displayed on screen,paper, or in another media type. CSS is used
                by designers to define styles for web pages, including the alyout and variation in display and the design
                for various devices. Additionally, I learned that the style definition is saved normally in external .css file.
                Css allows for a better control of web pages color, font, size of text, the spacing between elements,and the specific
                background images or colors are to be displayed.Css can also be added in three ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Inline, by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
                    <li>Internal, by using a style element in the head section</li>
                    <li>External, by using a link element to link to an external css file.
                </ul>
               <p>Also, I learned about the CSS color, font-family, and font-size properties to be used. CSS selector are used to find
                or select the HTML element that will be styled. CSS selectors are divided into five categories:
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple selector: which select elements based on name,id,class.</li>
                    <li>Combinator selectors: which select elements based on a specific relationship between them.</li>
                    <li>Pseudo-class selectors: Used to select elements based on certain state.</li>
                    <li>Pseudo-elements selectors: Select and style a part of an element.</li>
                    <li>Attribute selectors: Select elements based on an attribute or attribute value.</li>
                </ul>
