    <h2> First Paragrapgh</h2>
        <p>
            By doing this final prjoject, many lessons have been learned along the way.
            The project required me to have a different approach on how to build
            my website and how to proceed to add CSS for styling purpose. Choosing between my 
            previous labs to build from scratches was not an easy task. I did not know 
            how to create a connection between these different pages, but through my research, I found 
            out what was my mistake and why I was not able to link ages to each other. The solution 
            was that I have to add  a */link tag in the head section of my homepage with the 
            specific HTML file I want to link with.
