            <p> My first webpage! When I started this assignment
                I was a bit confused and it seemd like i woul not 
                be able to do it.As i started, after following instructions
                given; it became more clear and understanbable. I always go 
                back to read the course or the practices to see where i might have 
                difficulties. HTML BASICS helped me to have  better comprehension of 
                webpages and how they are conceived and displayed.

                        All tags should be lowercase
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tags can have attributes
